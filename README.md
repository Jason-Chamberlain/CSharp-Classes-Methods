# C# AND .NET - CLASSES & METHODS
This repository contains a collection of projects that were completed as part of the C# and .NET course at [The Tech Academy](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/), focusing specifically on the subject of methods. These projects provided hands-on experience in understanding and implementing methods in C# programming. Each project aimed to reinforce the concepts learned in the course and showcase their practical application.

## Calling Methods
[Link to Calling Methods README.md](./CallingMethods/README.md)

This C# .NET solution provides a practical demonstration of key concepts related to method creation, method invocation, and exception handling. It illustrates how methods can be defined in C# classes to execute specific tasks and how user input can serve as method parameters.

## Method Overloading
[Link to Method Overloading README.md](./MethodOverloading/README.md)

This C# .NET solution provides a practical demonstration of the key concept of method overloading. It illustrates how method overloading allows for the creation of versatile methods capable of accepting different data types as arguments.

## Method Optional Parameters
[Link to Method Optional Parameters README.md](./MethodOptionalParamatersAssignment/README.md)

This C# .NET solution provides a practical demonstration of key concepts related to method optional parameters. It showcases how to define methods with optional parameters and how they simplify method invocation.

## Inheritance
[Link to Inheritance README.md](./Inheritance/README.md)

This C# .NET solution provides a practical demonstration of the concept of inheritance and class hierarchy. It illustrates how classes can be organized in a hierarchical structure, inheriting properties and methods from base classes, while also extending functionality as needed.

## Class Abstraction
[Link to Class Abstraction README.md](./ClassAbstraction/README.md)

his C# .NET solution provides a practical demonstration of key concepts related to class abstraction, inheritance, and method override. Through this project, valuable insights were gained into the design of class hierarchies and the creation of specialized implementations in derived classes.

## Interfaces
[Link to Interfaces README.md](./Interfaces/)

This C# .NET solution provides a practical demonstration of key concepts related to interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism. It illustrates how interfaces define contracts for classes to implement, how abstract classes can contain both concrete and abstract methods, and how polymorphism allows for flexibility in interacting with objects.

## Parsing Enums
[Link to Parsing Enums README.md](./ParsingEnums/README.md)

This C# .NET solution provides a practical demonstration of key concepts related to enum definition and parsing. It illustrates how enums can be used to represent named constant values and how user input can be parsed into enum values.

## Lambda LINQ
[Link to Lambda LINQ README.md](./LambdaLinq/README.md)

This C# .NET solution provides a practical demonstration of key concepts related to the utilization of lambda expressions and LINQ. It illustrates how lambda expressions can simplify data manipulation tasks and how LINQ enables data querying and filtering in a concise and expressive manner.

## Date Time
[Link to Date Time README.md](./DateTime/README.md)

This C# .NET solution offers a practical demonstration of key concepts related to date and time manipulation by utilizing the `DateTime` class. It equips the skills necessary to work with date and time data, acquire user input, perform calculations, and present results.

## Try/Catch 
[Link to Try/Catch README.md](./TryCatch/README.md)

This C# .NET solution provides a practical demonstration of key concepts related to exception handling and input validation. It illustrates how try-catch blocks can be employed to gracefully manage exceptions and ensure program stability even when confronted with unexpected input or errors.
