# Interfaces
This README offers an overview of a C# .NET solution that focuses on the exploration and application of key concepts related to interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism. Below, we delve into the concepts and skills that were acquired through the creation of this solution.

## Solution Overview
### Utilization of Interfaces, Abstract Classes, and Polymorphism
In this C# .NET solution, a console application was created to demonstrate the following key aspects:

1. **Interface Creation**: An interface named `IQuittable` was created, defining a method called `Quit`. This interface represents a contract that must be adhered to by classes implementing it.

1. **Definition of an Abstract Class**: An abstract class named `Person` was defined. This class includes properties for `FirstName` and `LastName` and a virtual method named `SayName`.

1. **Inheritance and Implementation**: A class named `Employee` was created, which inherits from the `Person` class and implements the `IQuittable` interface. This class overrides the `SayName` method and implements the `Quit` method from the interface.

1. **Polymorphism in Action**: Polymorphism was demonstrated by creating an object of type `IQuittable` and using it to call the `Quit` method on an instance of the `Employee` class.

## Key Concepts Learned
### 1. Interfaces
**Interface Definition**: Understanding was gained regarding how to define interfaces in C#, serving as contracts that specify which methods a class must implement.

**Interface Implementation**: Knowledge was acquired about how to implement interfaces in classes, ensuring that the required methods are provided.

### 2. Abstract Classes
**Abstract Class Definition**: Knowledge was aquired about abstract classes, which can encompass both concrete methods and abstract methods (methods without implementation).

**Abstract Method**: An understanding was obtained of how to declare abstract methods within abstract classes, allowing subclasses to provide their own implementations.

### 3. Polymorphism
**Polymorphism**: The solution demonstrated the concept of polymorphism, where an object of an interface type (`IQuittable`) can be employed to interact with objects of a class implementing that interface (`Employee`).

**Method Overriding**: The `Employee` class overrides the `SayName` method from the base `Person` class, illustrating method overriding.

## Conclusion
This C# .NET solution provides a practical demonstration of key concepts related to interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism. It illustrates how interfaces define contracts for classes to implement, how abstract classes can contain both concrete and abstract methods, and how polymorphism allows for flexibility in interacting with objects. Understanding these concepts is essential for designing extensible and maintainable software in C# .NET, as they enable the creation of flexible and modular code.
