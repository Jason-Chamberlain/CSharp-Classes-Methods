# Exception Handling
This README presents an overview of a C# .NET solution that focuses on the concept of exception handling. The solution demonstrates how exceptions are handled in C# to ensure robust and error-tolerant code. Below, the key concepts and skills that were acquired through the creation of this solution are explored.

## Solution Overview
### Exception Handling
In this C# .NET solution, a console application is utilized to showcase the use of try-catch blocks for handling exceptions gracefully. The solution includes the following components:

1. **Program Class**: The `Main` method in the `Program` class employs a `while` loop to continuously prompt the user for their age until valid input is received.

1. **User Input and Validation**: User input for their age is requested, and an attempt is made to parse the input into an integer. Validation is performed to check whether the input is a positive number. If the input is not a valid positive number, suitable error messages are displayed.

1. **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks are used to encapsulate potential exception-throwing code. The solution features specific catch blocks for handling `FormatException` (arising from non-integer input) and a generic `Exception` catch block to manage other types of exceptions.

## Key Concepts Learned
### 1. Exception Handling
**Try-Catch Blocks**: Understanding was gained about how try-catch blocks are employed to enclose code segments that may throw exceptions. Try blocks enable the execution of potentially problematic code, while catch blocks handle exceptions when they occur.

**Exception Types**: The course covered the significance of identifying and addressing specific exception types, such as `FormatException`, to provide suitable error messages and maintain program stability.

**Generic Exception Handling**: Knowledge was acquired about using a catch block with a generic Exception type to capture and address unexpected exceptions. This aids in averting program crashes and offers meaningful error messages.

### 2. Input Validation
**User Input Validation**: I learned how to validate user input to ensure it meets specified criteria. In this solution, input validation ascertains that the user's age is a positive number.

**Looping for Valid Input**: The solution demonstrates how loops are utilized to repeatedly request valid input from the user until the criteria are met.

## Conclusion
This C# .NET solution provides a practical demonstration of key concepts related to exception handling and input validation. It illustrates how try-catch blocks can be employed to gracefully manage exceptions and ensure program stability even when confronted with unexpected input or errors. Understanding these concepts is essential for crafting robust and dependable C# applications capable of handling various user interactions and potential issues.
