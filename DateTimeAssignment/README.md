# DateTime Assignment
The primary focus of this solution is to explore and apply key concepts related to date and time manipulation, using the `DateTime` class. Below is an examination of the concepts and skills that were acquired through the creation of this solution.

## Solution Overview
### Usage of the DateTime Class
The solution is a console application that demonstrates the utilization of the `DateTime` class to carry out the following tasks:

1. **Displaying Current Date and Time**: The current date and time are displayed on the console using the `DateTime.Now` property.

1. **User Input**: The user is prompted to enter a number representing hours.

1. **Calculation of Date and Time**: The current time is augmented with the user input (hours) using the `AddHours` method, and the resulting time is displayed.

## Key Concepts Learned
### 1. DateTime Class
- **Access to Current Date and Time**: Understanding was acquired regarding the means to access and exhibit the current date and time through the `DateTime.Now` property.
### 2. User Input and Conversion
- **Console Input**: The course covered the process of obtaining user input from the console by means of the `Console.ReadLine` method.

- **Data Conversion**: Proficiency was attained in converting user input (in this instance, hours as a string) into the relevant data type (integer) using `Convert.ToInt32`.

### 3. Date and Time Manipulation
- **Addition of Hours**: This project provided practical experience in executing date and time calculations by adding a specified number of hours to the current time through the utilization of the `AddHours` method.
### 4. Console Output
- **Console.WriteLine**: The method was learned to utilize the `Console.WriteLine` method for the purpose of presenting messages and data on the console.

## Conclusion
This C# .NET solution offers a practical demonstration of key concepts related to date and time manipulation by utilizing the `DateTime` class. It equips the skills necessary to work with date and time data, acquire user input, perform calculations, and present results. A comprehension of these concepts is considered valuable for a wide range of applications, extending from scheduling and time-based operations to data analysis and reporting within the domain of C# .NET development.
